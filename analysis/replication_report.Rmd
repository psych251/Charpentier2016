##Introduction

Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986, 1992) stipulates that people make choices based on subjective values of the choices, and not from the objective values of the choice. In other words, in a gambling task, when presented with a sure option \$5 or a risky 50-50 option of either gaining \$10 or gaining \$0, prospect theory expects people to make their decisions based on how much they value \$5 dollars, relative to how much they value \$10. But is the subjective value in prospect theory a proxy of feeling?

Charpentier (2016) investigates this question by utilizing computational models. The authors are interested in whether a model based on feeling will be able to predict choices in a monetary gambling task better than a model based on objective values. The authors asked participants to rate how negatively or positively they would feel or expect to feel if they won or lost an object value. Those self-reported feelings where used to create a feeling function which relates objective values to a subjective feelings (expected or experienced). On a seperate task, the authors asked participants to choose between a sure option and a risky 50-50 option in a monetary gambling task. Feeling based choice model used the constructed feeling function to predict feelings associated with each objective value, and then used those predicted feelings to predict choice. Value based choice model only used objective value to predict choice. 


##Methods

###Power Analysis

Charpentier does not specify a power analysis for their main statistical test. Since their key analysis relys on model fitting, it is unclear on how to get enough participants to tell that one model performs better than another. However, the authors do specify a power analysis in a supplmentary analysis. I will use this test as a proxy for my power analysis, even though it may be an overestimation or underestimation of number of participants.

As part of their supplementary analysis, Charpentier used a paired t-test to compare the weights of losing coeficients to weights of wining coeficients. This test was to see of one was significantly larger than the other in the choice models.

Original paper reports:

> "We determined that a sample size
of 59 participants would achieve 85% power to detect an
effect size of 0.401 with an alpha of .05."

Using the effect size found in the original paper (d = 0.392) with an alpha of .05, 53 participants will achieve 80% power. Power calculations were run in G*Power v3.1.

###Planned Sample

For the sake of feasibility in collecting data. I plan to use 30 participants with a shorter version of their experiment. Although this significantly reduces the sample of the experiment, their main analysis is not the comparison of the weights of losing and wining to each other, but rather, the predictive power of the models itself, which don't depend on sample size as much as t-tests do. So, although power was not achieved for the test for weight comparison, it is still possible to evaluate how good fitted models are with only 30 participants.

There is no specific recruitment constraints in demographics since the original paper did not specify any.

###Materials

Basic geometric shapes were used for each stimulus in a trial. Each trial had a different geometric shape to ensure that associations of mo netary outcomes and the shapes did not carry throughout trials.

![Shapes](/Users/Michael/Documents/Psych_251/Charpentier2016/analysis/img/shapes.jpg)

JsPsych was used to create the experimental paradigm. Shapes were created from basic presentation software using basic shape functions and color palletes, and saved as an image.

###Procedure	

Directly quoted from the original paper, the two main tasks were as follows:

**Feeling Task**

In the feelings task, participants completed
four blocks of 40 to 48 trials each, in which they
reported either expected (Fig. 1a) or experienced (Fig.
1b) feelings associated with a range of wins and losses
(between £0.2 and £12) or with no change in monetary
amount (£0). At the beginning of each trial, participants
were told how much was at stake and whether it was a
win trial (e.g., "If you choose the GOOD picture, you
will: WIN £10") or a loss trial (e.g., "If you choose the
BAD picture, you will: LOSE £10"). On each trial, their
task was to make a simple arbitrary choice between two
different geometrical shapes. Participants were told that
one stimulus was randomly associated with a gain or loss
(between £0.2 and £12) and the other stimulus with no
gain and no loss (£0). Each stimulus was presented only
once across the entire task so there was no way for participants
to learn which stimulus was associated with a
better outcome. The probability of sampling each amount
was controlled to ensure that each gain and each loss
from the range was sampled twice in each block: In one
instance, the outcome was the amount at stake (win/loss),
and in the other, the outcome was £0 (no win/no loss).

In two of the four blocks (counterbalanced order),
participants reported their expected feelings prior to
choosing between the two stimuli (Fig. 1a), and in the
other two blocks, they reported their experienced feelings
after choosing between the two stimuli (Fig. 1b).
Participants reported their expected feelings by answering
one of four questions asking how they would feel if
they "win," "lose," "don't win," or "don't lose" (the order
of win/lose and don't-win/don't-lose questions was
counterbalanced across trials). In experienced-feelings
blocks, participants answered the question "How do you
feel now?" All feelings were rated using a subjective rating
scale ranging from extremely unhappy to extremely
happy. Expected and experienced feelings were collected
in different blocks to ensure participants did not simply
remember and repeat the same rating. The choice
between the two geometrical shapes was arbitrary and
implemented simply in order to have participants actively
involved with the outcomes.

**Gambling Task**

Participants also completed a probabilistic-
choice task (Fig. 1c) in which they made 288 to
322 choices between a risky 50-50 gamble and a sure
option. Importantly, all the amounts used in the gambling
task were the same as those used in the feelings
task (between £0.2 and £12), so feelings associated with
these outcomes could be combined to predict gambling
choice. There were three gamble types: mixed (participants
had to choose between a gamble with a 50%
chance of a gain and 50% chance of a loss, or a sure
option of £0), gain only (participants had to choose
between a gamble with a 50% chance of a high gain and
a 50% chance of £0, or a sure, smaller gain), and loss
only (participants had to choose between a gamble with
50% chance of a high loss and 50% chance of £0, or a
sure, smaller loss). According to prospect theory, these
three types of choices are essential to estimate loss aversion,
risk preference for gains, and risk preference for
losses, respectively.

###Analysis Plan

Only exclusion criteria is removing participant data who show no variation in response.

**Feeling Function Models**

Model subjective feelings from three different baselines: difference from the midpoint of the rating scale, difference from the rating reported on the previous trial (for experienced feelings only), and difference from the corresponding zero outcome.

10 different models were fit for each feeling block, expected and experienced. Each model was fit to every participants (See Charpentier2016, p.4 for model formula). Best model in each feeling block was determiend by using summed BIC as model selection criterion and 100 split half analysis. 

**Gambling Choice Models**

Each choice model used logistic regression on three predictors, a win value, loss value and sure value, to predict gambling choice (coded "1" for selecting the risky 50-50, or "0" for selecting the sure option). 7 different choice models were fitted for every participant. Choice model 1 and 2 are feeling models using the best fitting feeling function to transform objective values to subjective values. Choice model 3 - 7 are value based models using either raw objective values or a transformation of the raw objective value such as logarithm (See Charpentier2016, p.5 and Supplementary Material, p.3 for model formula). Best model was deteremined by using BIC as model selection criterion and 100 split half analysis. 

Weights associated with win and weights associated with loss are compared. From their key choice model of interest, these weights are extracted, standardized and then compared using paired sample t test and repeated measures ANOVA.

**Key Analysis**

Key analysis tests whether feeling based choice models (Choice Model 1, 2) predict better than value based choice models (Choice Model 3 - 7).


###Differences from Original Study

I'm using a smaller sample size in order to fit the contraints of the class budget. Furthermore, I'm using less trials in each feeling block. Instead of 2 blocks of 48 trials for each expected and experienced blocks, I'm only using 1 block of 48 trials. Gambling trial length remains the same.

The authors used Maximum Likehood Estimation algorithm from MATLAB to fit their models. I will use Nonlinear Solver (nls() function) in R using Gauss-Newton algorithm. The keydifference between MLE in Matlab and nls() in R is that nls() estimates parameters based on least squares, and MLE estimates parameters on maximum log likehood. This difference yields different parameter estimations and different BIC calculations, but does not detract from model comparison.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

I think graphing and displaying the mean accuracy of each model is nice so that readers would have a intuitive idea of the predictive power of each model.

### Confirmatory analysis

**Data Visualization**

The below graph shows the average reported expected and experienced feeling with each objective value. Standard error bars are shown.

```{r}
feel_expect_sum <- summarySE(feel_expect, measurevar = "response", groupvars = c("value"))
feel_expect_sum$type <- "Expected Feelings"
feel_experience_sum <- summarySE(feel_experience, measurevar = "response", groupvars = c("value"))
feel_experience_sum$type <- "Experienced Feelings"

feel_data_sum <- rbind(feel_expect_sum, feel_experience_sum)

ggplot(data = feel_data_sum,
                        aes(x = value, y = response, col = type)) +
        geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=response-se, ymax=response+se), colour="black", width=.1, position=position_dodge(0.1)) +
        geom_point(position=position_dodge(0.1), size=3, shape=21, fill="white") +
        ggtitle("Feeling Function")
        
```

**Comparing Feeling Models**

First we fit Feeling Models 1 - 10 for both expected and experienced feelings, and select the best model with the lowest sum across all participants BIC.

```{r warning = FALSE}
## no boostrapping
feeling_models_nosplit <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 20, nrow = 1))

## init names of the columns
model_names <- character(20)
for(i in 1:10){
        model_names[i] <- paste0("feel_expect_mod", i)
}
        
for(i in 11:20){
        model_names[i] <- paste0("feel_experience_mod", i - 10)
}

colnames(feeling_models_nosplit) <- model_names

feel_fit(split = FALSE, nparticipants)
feeling_models_nosplit[1, ] <- feel_BIC(nparticipants)

```

Expected Feeling Model

Original:

![Expected Feeling Model](/Users/Michael/Documents/Psych_251/Charpentier2016/analysis/img/expected_feeling_model.jpg)

```{r plot_expected_feeling_models}

Experienced Feeling Model

**Choice Models**

Next, we fit Choice Model 1-7, and select the best model with the lowest sum across all participants BIC. Same fitting procedure is repeated with 100 iterations for split half boostrap analysis.

### Commentary

I'm not sure why there is a negative BIC for model 5, I will investigate that later. The BIC values are a function of participant number, so if you compare my graphs to the original, you will notice that the original has much larger BIC's. This difference may also be reflective of the different trial numbers that I use in the feeling block.
