##Introduction

Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986, 1992) stipulates that people make choices based on subjective values of the choices, and not from the objective values of the choice. In other words, in a gambling task, when presented with a sure option \$5 or a risky 50-50 option of either gaining \$10 or gaining \$0, prospect theory expects people to make their decisions based on how much they value \$5 dollars, relative to how much they value \$10. But is the subjective value in prospect theory a proxy of feeling?

Charpentier (2016) investigates this question by utilizing computational models. The authors are interested in whether a model based on feeling will be able to predict choices in a monetary gambling task better than a model based on objective values. The authors asked participants to rate how negatively or positively they would feel or expect to feel if they won or lost an object value. Those self-reported feelings were used to create a feeling function which relates objective values to a subjective feelings (expected or experienced). On a separate task, the authors asked participants to choose between a sure option and a risky 50-50 option in a monetary gambling task. Feeling based choice model used the constructed feeling function to predict feelings associated with each objective value, and then used those predicted feelings to predict choice. Value based choice model only used objective value to predict choice. 

##Methods

###Power Analysis

Charpentier does not specify a power analysis for their main statistical test. Since their key analysis relies on model fitting, it is unclear on how to get enough participants to tell that one model performs better than another. However, the authors do specify a power analysis in a supplementary analysis. I will use this test as a proxy for my power analysis, even though it may be an overestimation or underestimation of number of participants.

As part of their supplementary analysis, Charpentier used a paired t-test to compare the weights of losing coefficients to weights of winning coefficients. This test was to see of one was significantly larger than the other in the choice models.

Original paper reports:

> "We determined that a sample size of 59 participants would achieve 85% power to detect an
effect size of 0.401 with an alpha of .05."

Using the effect size found in the original paper (d = 0.392) with an alpha of .05, 53 participants will achieve 80% power. Power calculations were run in G*Power v3.1.

###Planned Sample

For the sake of feasibility in collecting data. 30 participants with a shorter version of their experiment was planned. Although this significantly reduces the sample of the experiment, their main analysis is not the comparison of the weights of losing and winning to each other, but rather, the predictive power of the models itself, which don't depend on sample size as much as t-tests do. So, although power was not achieved for the test for weight comparison, it is still possible to evaluate how good fitted models are with only 30 participants.

There is no specific recruitment constraints in demographics since the original paper did not specify any.

###Materials

Basic geometric shapes were used for each stimulus in a trial. Each trial had a different geometric shape to ensure that associations of monetary outcomes and the shapes did not carry throughout trials.

![Shapes](/Users/Michael/Documents/Psych_251/Charpentier2016/analysis/img/shapes.jpg)

JsPsych was used to create the experimental paradigm. Shapes were created from basic presentation software using basic shape functions and color palettes, and saved as an image.

###Procedure	

Participants completed two tasks, a feeling task and a gambling task. The order of the two tasks are counterbalanced. Directly quoted from the original paper, the two main tasks were as follows:

**Feeling Task**

> In the feelings task, participants completed four blocks of 40 to 48 trials each, in which they reported either expected (Fig. 1a) or experienced (Fig. 1b) feelings associated with a range of wins and losses (between £0.2 and £12) or with no change in monetary amount (£0). At the beginning of each trial, participants were told how much was at stake and whether it was a win trial (e.g., "If you choose the GOOD picture, you will: WIN £10") or a loss trial (e.g., "If you choose the BAD picture, you will: LOSE £10"). On each trial, their task was to make a simple arbitrary choice between two different geometrical shapes. Participants were told that
one stimulus was randomly associated with a gain or loss (between £0.2 and £12) and the other stimulus with no gain and no loss (£0). Each stimulus was presented only once across the entire task so there was no way for participants to learn which stimulus was associated with a better outcome. The probability of sampling each amount was controlled to ensure that each gain and each loss from the range was sampled twice in each block: In one instance, the outcome was the amount at stake (win/loss), and in the other, the outcome was £0 (no win/no loss).

> In two of the four blocks (counterbalanced order), participants reported their expected feelings prior to choosing between the two stimuli (Fig. 1a), and in the other two blocks, they reported their experienced feelings after choosing between the two stimuli (Fig. 1b). Participants reported their expected feelings by answering one of four questions asking how they would feel if they "win," "lose," "don't win," or "don't lose" (the order of win/lose and don't-win/don't-lose questions was counterbalanced across trials). In experienced-feelings blocks, participants answered the question "How do you feel now?" All feelings were rated using a subjective rating scale ranging from extremely unhappy to extremely happy. Expected and experienced feelings were collected in different blocks to ensure participants did not simply remember and repeat the same rating. The choice between the two geometrical shapes was arbitrary and implemented simply in order to have participants actively involved with the outcomes.

**Gambling Task**

> Participants also completed a probabilistic-choice task (Fig. 1c) in which they made 288 to 322 choices between a risky 50-50 gamble and a sure option. Importantly, all the amounts used in the gambling task were the same as those used in the feelings task (between £0.2 and £12), so feelings associated with these outcomes could be combined to predict gambling choice. There were three gamble types: mixed (participants had to choose between a gamble with a 50% chance of a gain and 50% chance of a loss, or a sure option of £0), gain only (participants had to choose between a gamble with a 50% chance of a high gain and a 50% chance of £0, or a sure, smaller gain), and loss only (participants had to choose between a gamble with 50% chance of a high loss and 50% chance of £0, or a sure, smaller loss). According to prospect theory, these three types of choices are essential to estimate loss aversion, risk preference for gains, and risk preference for losses, respectively.

###Analysis Plan

Only exclusion criteria is removing participant data who show no variation in response.

Participant responses from the feeling task will be used to map objective values to subjective feeling by fitting outlined *feeling model*. Participant choices from the gambling task will be predicted by affect based choices that rely on the best feeling model, or value based choices that rely on either the monetary values presented during the gambling task, or simple transformations of the monetary values. **Key analysis** tests whether feeling based choice models (Choice Model 1, 2) predict better than value based choice models (Choice Model 3 - 7).

**Feeling Function Models**

Model subjective feelings from three different baselines: difference from the midpoint of the rating scale, difference from the rating reported on the previous trial (for experienced feelings only), and difference from the corresponding zero outcome.

In order to capture the relationship between subjective feeling and objective values, 10 different models were fit for each feeling block, expected and experienced. These models were either linear, or s-shaped, with slight variations such as piecewise fitting (where the parameters of positive and negative values are estimated separately) or intercept terms (expecting that the feeling associated with +0 is not 0). See Charpentier2016, p.4 for model formula. Each model was fit to every participants. Best model in each feeling block was determined by selecting the model with the least summed BIC across all participants. 

**Gambling Choice Models**

Each choice model used logistic regression on three predictors, a win value, loss value and sure value, to predict gambling choice (coded "1" for selecting the risky 50-50, or "0" for selecting the sure option). 7 different choice models were fitted for every participant. Choice model 1 and 2 are feeling models using the best fitting feeling function from the expected feeling block and experienced feeling block respectively to transform objective values to subjective values. Choice model 3 - 7 are value based models using either raw objective values or a transformation of the raw objective value such as logarithm (See Charpentier2016, p.5 and Supplementary Material, p.3 for model formula). Best model was determined by using BIC as model selection criterion and 100 split half analysis. 

###Differences from Original Study

One key difference is that the original study did not use an online sample. The original study recruits participants from students in a university who complete the study in an inlab visit. This replication recruits participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk, and have participants complete the experiment on an online browser. 

For simplicity sake of constructing the experimental paradigm on the web, this replication does not counterbalance the order of the feeling task and the gambling task. Furthermore, the order of the expected feeling block and the experienced feeling block within the feeling task is not counterbalanced. 

The author's do not explicitly state the use of practice trials, however in order to keep the replication experimental paradigm short for the online sample, practice trials were not included. Results of the replication should not be affected significantly since all analysis only look at choice, and not measures that could be affected significantly by lack of practice trials such as reaction time.

In order to fit the constraints of the class budget, a smaller sample size was used. Instead of the planned 53 in the power analysis, only 30 participants were recruited. 

In order to keep the replication experimental paradigm to around 30 minutes, a shortened version of the experimental paradigm was administered. Instead of 2 blocks of 48 trials for each expected and experienced blocks, participants completed only 1 block of 48 trials for each. Gambling trial length remains the same. Reducing feeling trials may create poorer fits of the feeling models. However, BIC scores can still be extracted and utilized for model comparison. 

Given the constraint of the class budget, replication experiment did not provide any monetary incentive based on performance on the gambling task. The original paper does not specify this component as part of payment, but may be a potential source of difference.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

Split half, cross validated accuracy will be graphed for each choice function. In other words, training and estimation of the model parameters will use a random subset of one half of the data, while accuracy scores are extracted from testing on the other half of the data. Accuracy will not be used as the basis for model comparison, since accuracy scores do not control for the number of parameters fitted to the data, but provides an intuitive gauge of the predictive power of the model, relative to chance level (50%).

**Data Visualization**

The below graph shows the average reported expected and experienced feeling with each objective value. Standard error bars are shown.

```{r message=F}
feel_expect_sum <- summarySE(feel_expect, measurevar = "response", groupvars = c("value"))
feel_expect_sum$type <- "Expected Feelings"
feel_experience_sum <- summarySE(feel_experience, measurevar = "response", groupvars = c("value"))
feel_experience_sum$type <- "Experienced Feelings"

feel_data_sum <- rbind(feel_expect_sum, feel_experience_sum)

**Comparing Feeling Models**

First we fit Feeling Models 1 - 10 for both expected and experienced feelings, and select the best model with the lowest sum across all participants BIC.

```{r warning = FALSE, message=F}
## no boostrapping
feeling_models <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 20, nrow = 1))

## init names of the columns
model_names <- character(20)
for(i in 1:10){
        model_names[i] <- paste0("feel_expect_mod", i)
}
        
for(i in 11:20){
        model_names[i] <- paste0("feel_experience_mod", i - 10)
}

colnames(feeling_models) <- model_names

feel_fit(nparticipants)
feeling_models[1, ] <- feel_BIC(nparticipants)

```

Expected Feeling Model

**Choice Models**

Next, we fit Choice Model 1-7, and select the best model with the lowest sum across all participants BIC. Same fitting procedure is repeated with 100 iterations for split half boostrap analysis. 

*Key analysis: BIC of Model 1,2 < BIC of Model 3-7*
